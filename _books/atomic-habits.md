In my entire library, "Atomic Habits" is probably the most well-known book. It's easy to understand why. It applies to a wide range of people regardless of their profession. For the same reason, I have always chosen other books as my next picks, as they seemed more relevant to me. But the day finally came, and I gave it a try as an audiobook while riding my bicycle.

The book greatly outperformed my expectations. Now I understand why it is a bestseller. It is well-balanced, informative and easy to follow. Not even a tiny problem I have found with it.

Over its 20 chapters, it builds a system for establishing good habits and breaking bad ones. The system is supported by four laws, such as "make it obvious", "make it attractive", "make it easy" and finally "make it satisfying". All the chapters are well explained with the addition of little stories.

One surprise of the book was that it gave me a deeper insight into myself. While reading, I recognised myself in the examples. Sometimes related to my good habits, and other times not quite like them. Yeah, I'm also just a human in the end.

Another surprise was how often I found connections to my other readings, in topics such as behavioural economics, neurology, and lean production.

My favourite statement from the book is _"Winners and losers have the same goals"_.

What I like the most
- It delivers what it promises
- Well-structured, informative, interesting
- Let the reader better understand themselves
- It widened my overall knowledge

What I didn't like much:
- Nothing
