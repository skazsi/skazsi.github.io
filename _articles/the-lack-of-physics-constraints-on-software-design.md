Software engineering is undoubtedly a branch of engineering. It utilizes scientific and mathematical principles to address problems. It requires a creative application of knowledge and technology to create solutions that improve the functionality and efficiency of various processes, products, and infrastructures. However, there is a crucial difference between software engineering and traditional engineering disciplines. While the laws of physics constrain traditional engineering designs, software designs do not face these limitations. This freedom can be appealing for software engineers, but it also presents its own set of challenges. Before exploring those challenges, let's examine how traditional engineering is influenced by the laws of physics.

An average passenger can hardly find significant differences between planes while waiting for their next flight. They generally share similar silhouettes, wing profiles, landing gear, and engine placement. The internal layout and structure are likely identical, although these details may not be visible to the average observer. While regulations certainly influence their design, planes primarily adhere to the laws of physics related to motion, gravity, aerodynamics, and thermodynamics. Even seemingly minor differences in design could compromise the plane's flight efficiency, pose safety risks, or even prevent the aircraft from taking off altogether.

Boeing 737 MAX is a tragic example of such consequences. The world was shocked when two of the brand-new 737 MAX planes crashed in late 2018 and early 2019 in less than five months. Investigations revealed that the famous Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) was the direct cause of the tragedies, as it overrode the pilots' control to prevent assumed stalls at elevated angles of attack.

What is less known is that the MCAS was a patch intended to fix a design flaw in the 737 MAX. In pursuit of fuel efficiency and cost savings, Boeing installed much larger engines on the 737 airframe and named it MAX. However, they faced a significant issue: the new engines were so large that they did not provide enough ground clearance on the 737 airframe. Repositioning the engines higher on the wings was the only possible solution. However, this seemingly insignificant modification altered the plane's flight characteristics and increased the likelihood of stalling at full thrust, leading to the installation of the MCAS system. It sounds like Boeing took shortcuts one after the other, and they indeed did.

The tragic story of the Boeing 737 MAX clearly illustrates the constraints physics imposes on traditional engineering design. These constraints are unbreakable, so planes are similar; there is no other way.

On the other hand, if the 737 MAX were software, we could quickly fix the ground clearance problem by increasing the height of the landing gears. Ultimately, the landing gear would be a loosely coupled component to the airframe in well-written software. Also, a software-based landing gear has nothing to do with Newton's Laws of Motion. So why would the plane have any landing gear after all? Boeing could have addressed the issue by taking inspiration from a podracer from Star Wars: The Phantom Menace. They could have arranged the two engines in front of the airframe, connected by energy binders that appear as beams of light or energy streams. While it sounds funny, some software engineers would implement such an idea as how much software engineers enjoy creating their own frameworks.
