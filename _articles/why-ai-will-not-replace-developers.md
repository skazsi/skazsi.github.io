What a few individuals worked on for decades is now amazing millions. Suddenly everyone wants to participate in it. Everyone plays with it and looks for potential usage of it. Everyone wants artificial intelligence in their products, services, or applications, and that's all right. It is the time to be amazed and also to overreact it.

When the blockchain in the 2010s was hyped, as an example, many opinions forecasted the end of traditional retail banking and the centralised interbank clearing systems. This time has also yet to arrive. While AI has a much broader potential usage than blockchain, it will take time until AI will assist our daily life. Our society needs to manage moral,  legal, intellectual property and security concerns, among other challenges. Still, AI is here and slowly and steadily will occupy more territories in our lives.

We, software professionals, can also be amazed by the capabilities of AI. It generates working code in a few seconds based on some statements. A good business analyst can put together some well-specified requirements in a user story, and voila, in seconds, we have the working code for it. Now we can look for a new profession. Well, not quite right.

If we compare the usage of AI in software engineering and other areas, such as content creation, there is a fundamental difference. The AI-generated code is for machines, while the AI-generated document, essay, article, picture, or whatsoever is for humans. But why this makes a difference?

Humans are context-sensitive. We put the AI-generated artefact in a context like any other non-AI-generated artefact. For example, assuming a business proposal document is either generated by AI or not, the consumer of this document is a human who can understand the exact meaning independently of the used vocabulary, grammatical, semantical, or formatting variations. It is because we know and understand the context of that document. We know our business partners, the companies they work for, their cultural backgrounds, habits and personalities, business standards, previous experience, and everything. Without realising it, we associate all our knowledge with a particular artefact, creating a comprehensive and interconnected information set.

On the contrary, the source code does not have such a context. Refrain from getting confused by code execution context, like what variables are visible in the current moment of the execution. I mean a similar context that humans can work with. For the machine, every possible code variation has a distinct meaning. These code variations shift the code up and down on spectrums, such as performance, fault tolerance, security, maintainability, testability, usability and so forth, always resulting in a different application and meaning. Even though this spectrum approach is overly simplified compared to the real complexity of the software products, it might help to get my point.

All software products have their unique functional and non-functional requirements. Let's take an example. We have a batch application that reads up some data from somewhere. Then it processes the data that might mean some transformation, enrichment, etc. Finally, it writes it out somewhere else. So far, it is a straightforward task. Today's AI can generate such an application in seconds. But is this a production-ready application?

Here are only a few aspects to worry about. How much data should we be concerned about? Do we need to perform the processing in chunks instead of in one go? Do the input or output support transactions? Where are the transaction boundaries? How to deal with failures? What to do after a restart? How to handle overlapping executions of the same batch? What future features do we need to accommodate? Any data to be cached? How to test the application? On what infrastructure it needs to run? What enterprise standards and tech stack do we need to comply with?

When an enterprise-level software product is ready, the development team has made dozens of thousands of decisions. Some were majors, and many were minors. But nearly every second, they made macro decisions during coding. All of those decisions ended up in hopefully perfectly balanced behaviour.

If you are not a software engineer, think of a new car. Imagine how many decisions the manufacturer needed to make to provide your dream car. Here are a few aspects to consider: aerodynamics, good looking, used materials and their availability, drivetrain options, efficiency, safety, maintainability, reliability, interior design, practicality, costs, logistics, etc.

I'm not questioning how much AI can help in the design process of a new car. How great is it to render some abstract shapes for our new vehicles that the design team can refine further? Similarly, we should grab the opportunity and increase our software engineering capabilities by AI assisting options. But as you will not sit in a fully AI-designed car in the upcoming decades, you will also not use fully AI-written programs for a long time.
