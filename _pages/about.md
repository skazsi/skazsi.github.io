My relationship with computers started very early. Although I was just a few years old, I still remember that day. It all began in Vienna at Mariahilferstrasse 77 on August 26, 1988. My brother and I chased each other on the escalator in a big shopping mall while my parents spent their last Western currencies in an electronic shop. At that moment, when they bought our first computerâ€”a Commodore 16 for 1990 Austrian Schilling, I stumbled on the escalator and injured my knee so badly that we had to rush to the hospital. Yes, it was a rough start. Although the computer had gone for a long time, my mom kept the receipt for some reason, just like I kept the scar on my leg.

As a small boy, I played a lot on the C16. I spent an enormous amount of time with games like Loco Co-Co, Bandits at Zero, Punchy, Zylon, and Trailblazer. I am trying to remember how I started to code, but my first program that seems worth remembering was a family data bank. It was about personal data like name, birth date, etc., about all of our family members, including our dog, Cumi. It was full of GOTO statements. So, we can say that I didn't consider the GOTO statement harmful as a small boy.
